# Welcome to my Digital Portfolio 

## About Me 
My name is Savana Thomas, and I am an IT major at UCF. I have begun my final year at UCF and will be graduating this Fall 2025. I have accumulated various skills from both school and work experience. I am proficient in several coding languages including Python, Java, C, and C++. I have taken classes in database management and learned MySQL, as well as computer repair and maintenance. I know the basics of information security, web design, and I taught myself Markdown. For more than five years I worked during the summer on a family-owned watermelon farm advancing to the position of assistant floor manager of the packaging and shipping operation. I held duties such as managing loading operations and ran effective communication between the head floor manager and office workers. The environment was fast paced and I also accumulated skills in multitasking and customer service. I am open to all IT related work as I would like to develop a wide range of experience in all areas of the IT field.
