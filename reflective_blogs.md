# Wayback Analysis

## Assignment Rationale 
This assignment asks you to explore websites that don't follow contemporary standards in order to think critically about what standards you as a visitor have come to expect and to contemplate why these designs have become so standard across so many different types of sites.

## Where to Start
Analyze an early website using the Wayback MachineLinks to an external site. Search for an old version of your favorite digital source of news, entertainment, shopping, etc. Make note of its layout and things that you find surprising, out of the ordinary, or just plain odd.  

## What is Due
Write a short analysis of your findings, and post it in your Reflective Blog section of your Portfolio Website.

Based on your analysis, what norms do we expect websites to have? How jarring is it to see a site that does not follow these norms? What was the experience like for you, a modern Internet user, visiting this outdated site?
### Tips
Technical writing is clear and concise. Limit adverbs and excessive description. 
Remember: never, ever post one giant wall of text for any assignment in this course! 
Break your writing up with space between paragraphs
Feel free to also use headings, images, and gifs
Your writing can be in first person (I, me, my, mine), and it can include opinions
Your writing should still be formal enough for this digital portfolio to be included as part of your job application materials. 

## Assignment
For this assignment I chose to compare the Archive of Our Own, also referred to as Ao3, fanfiction website in its preset day for to the late 2009 version. This was a very shocking experience as I had not realized how the standards for web design had changed.
images = ![Ao3 2009 version](image.jpg)  images = ![Ao3 2025  version](!https://github.com/Savana2020/ENC4265/blob/main/Ao3_2025))

The most obvious difference was in the menu of the site. Almost every website today has a top menu usually held with a bar to distinguish it from its surroundings, but for this old version of the page it had its menu bar on the left side, which although not uncommon it was not a separate unmoving section but just part of the page. 
Which leads me to my next observation, sectioning. There were sections in the 2009 version of Ao3 but only distinguished though bolded text as headings, there was no distinct sectioning with boxes of any kind not even lines. While the current version of the website has headers of larger size and color along with lines to show different sections as well as a alternate color background for a box section.

A few other differences are in the links, menu, and design. The old website still has blue links which is something I had not realized was obsolete until I saw it. The current website menu and login are both drop down while the previous version does not have that capability. There is also a lot less color, the old version only has one part with color and thatâ€™s a picture of the logo, whereas the current version has the websites signature color, red, incorporated into the site as a background color in the menu and footer, as well as the color for headings and the title of the website.

The website felt incredibly old; it was at times difficult to navigate due to me unconsciously expecting things to be in different places.

# Quick Start Guide

## Assignment Rationale 
This assignment will let you experiment with a generative AI tool of your choice, and you will strengthen your critical thinking skills as you evaluate its strengths and weaknesses.

## Where to Start
Think of a product that you already know how to use. It can be a bluetooth headset, an app, a video game, a sewing machine, or anything that requires a little bit of setup to use.

## Assignment Steps
This assignment is a little more structured than others in our course, so please follow these steps:
1. Open Copilot or any other text-based generative AI tool you prefer (don't pay for it unless you happen to already have a subscription)
2. Write a prompt that asks it to generate a quick-start guide for your product of choice. (copy and paste this somewhere - it is part of what you need to turn in)
3. Evaluate the output. Try to follow the steps yourself, or at least imagine following them.
4. Prompt it again (and again) if needed (again saving your prompts somewhere).
5. Reflect on the process and write a short (200 words) reflection on the tool's strengths, weaknesses, and anything that you learned (or anything that surprised you).

## What is Due
On your portfolio, post the following:
- The name of the tool (with the link if you have it)
- Your prompts
- The best output 
- Your reflection
