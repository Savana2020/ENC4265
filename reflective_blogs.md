# Wayback Analysis

## Assignment Rationale 
This assignment asks you to explore websites that don't follow contemporary standards in order to think critically about what standards you as a visitor have come to expect and to contemplate why these designs have become so standard across so many different types of sites.

## Where to Start
Analyze an early website using the Wayback MachineLinks to an external site. Search for an old version of your favorite digital source of news, entertainment, shopping, etc. Make note of its layout and things that you find surprising, out of the ordinary, or just plain odd.  

## What is Due
Write a short analysis of your findings, and post it in your Reflective Blog section of your Portfolio Website.

Based on your analysis, what norms do we expect websites to have? How jarring is it to see a site that does not follow these norms? What was the experience like for you, a modern Internet user, visiting this outdated site?
### Tips
Technical writing is clear and concise. Limit adverbs and excessive description. 
Remember: never, ever post one giant wall of text for any assignment in this course! 
Break your writing up with space between paragraphs
Feel free to also use headings, images, and gifs
Your writing can be in first person (I, me, my, mine), and it can include opinions
Your writing should still be formal enough for this digital portfolio to be included as part of your job application materials. 

## Assignment
For this assignment I chose to compare the Archive of Our Own, also referred to as Ao3, fanfiction website in its preset day for to the late 2009 version. This was a very shocking experience as I had not realized how the standards for web design had changed.
 ![Ao3 2009 version](Ao3_2009.jpg)  ![Ao3 2025  version](Ao3_2025.jpg)

The most obvious difference was in the menu of the site. Almost every website today has a top menu usually held with a bar to distinguish it from its surroundings, but for this old version of the page it had its menu bar on the left side, which although not uncommon it was not a separate unmoving section but just part of the page. 
Which leads me to my next observation, sectioning. There were sections in the 2009 version of Ao3 but only distinguished though bolded text as headings, there was no distinct sectioning with boxes of any kind not even lines. While the current version of the website has headers of larger size and color along with lines to show different sections as well as a alternate color background for a box section.

A few other differences are in the links, menu, and design. The old website still has blue links which is something I had not realized was obsolete until I saw it. The current website menu and login are both drop down while the previous version does not have that capability. There is also a lot less color, the old version only has one part with color and thatâ€™s a picture of the logo, whereas the current version has the websites signature color, red, incorporated into the site as a background color in the menu and footer, as well as the color for headings and the title of the website.

The website felt incredibly old; it was at times difficult to navigate due to me unconsciously expecting things to be in different places.

# Quick Start Guide

## Assignment Rationale 
Changes in technology can cause disruptive changes across many industries! On the job in the computer industry, it is likely that you will be asked to complete quick-start guides, tutorials, instructional videos, and manuals in a very short amount of time. Other careers may also require these skills, and given how many of us rely on computers in our daily lives, the updates that are constantly being pushed out, unfortunately, sometimes seem to take the approach of "update now, explain the update to users later" (anybody remember Windows 8Links to an external site.?).

You need to be able to quickly figure out a platform on your own, and then clearly explain how to use it in writing, image, or video (or a combination of these).

## Where to Start
Select a product to explain how to use it right out of the box (this is a figure of speech--your product does not have to come in a box). This can be a video game console, photo editing software, a smart watch, Instagram, an InstantPot, or anything you'd like. The key is that you are writing to a complete novice: somebody who has no idea what to do. Do not assume that your reader has any prior knowledge about any aspect of your product.

If you're a Windows user, you should have a Snipping ToolLinks to an external site. installed on your computer already. Search your programs for "snipping tool" (I pinned mine to my taskbar for easy access). This tool will let you take a full screen screenshot or select just a portion of your screen--then you can save it as an image and modify it further if needed using any photo editing software you have. This is ideal if you are explaining software or some other digital platform.

If you're a Mac user, I am sure you have something similar. Here's what I found that might be helpful: https://setapp.com/how-to/snipping-tool-for-macLinks to an external site.

## What is Due
A direct link to this post on your Reflective Blog page on your website that includes:

Clear, step-by-step instructions that state what to do to begin using the product
At least 3 images or screenshots that illustrate 3 different steps (decorative images of the product or its logo do not count)
Easy-to-understand language so that someone who has never heard of your product could successfully complete the process 
Tone of a professional tutorial: doesn't sound condescending too informal
This must be typed directly on your website. The only exception is if you are using Github Pages and it is new to you. In that case only, you can upload a PDF to your Github repository and send me the link to that file on your repository, because screenshots are difficult to center in Markdown. Please name your file something obvious like QuickStartGuide so I can find it.
### Note:
if your website is password-protected, you must add a comment on the assignment submission with your password so I can grade it. No password or a link that does not work will result in a 0.

## Assignment type: Vintage
Since this is the first attempt at true technical writing in this course, I'd like to see how you do without AI tools. Please come up with the steps using your own brain. You may use Grammarly or Spellcheck without adding a note on your post for this one. You may use an AI tool to edit, but please prompt the AI for clear technical writing, ask it to avoid adverbs, and add a statement at the bottom that says "writing edited by ___" and then put the tool you used.

## Tips
Start with the very first, basic step: open the box, click this link to download the software, etc.
Only include action steps. The quick-start guide only explains how to do something, not why. (The "why" goes in a different genre we will practice later!)
Never, ever, ever send your user to a search engine. "Go Google this product name" is almost guaranteed to lose your audience to another (better) Quick-start guide.
Keep it simple! This is a Quick-Start Guide--you are guiding your reader to just the basics of using the product as quickly as possible. Don't waste their time with tangents or wordy explanations (I'm looking at YOU recipe blogs that make us scroll through your random life stories before getting to the recipe!)
Number each step
Bold key words to help your reader skim and quickly find the information they need.
Caption your images with Figure 1. And a short sentence or phrase describing the image.
You can use second person (you/your/yours), but be sure your tone is that of a professional tutorial and doesn't sound condescending or overly informal. 
Please avoid violent words like: hit, smash, slam.
Please avoid wordy slang: "you're going to want to head over to..."
