### Introduction 
Welcome to your new PlayStation 5! This comprehensive guide will walk you through the complete setup process for your PS5 console, from unboxing to playing your first game. The PS5 represents the next generation of gaming with lightning-fast loading, stunning graphics, and immersive features like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers on the DualSense controller. 

This manual covers everything you need to know to get started, including physical setup, connections, account creation, data transfer from previous consoles, and basic troubleshooting. Whether you're new to PlayStation or upgrading from a previous console, this guide will ensure you get the most out of your PS5 experience.

### What's in the Box 
Before beginning setup, verify that your PS5 package contains all the necessary components:
 Figure 1: Standard contents of a PS5 retail package
- PlayStation 5 console
- DualSense wireless controller
- Console base (stand)
- HDMI cable
- AC power cord
- USB-C to USB-A cable (for controller charging)
- Printed materials (Quick Start Guide, Safety Guide)
- Astro's Playroom (pre-installed game)
**Note:** If any items are missing, contact PlayStation Support immediately.

---
### Console Setup 
**Attaching the Console Base**
The PS5 console base (or feet) must be attached whether you position your console horizontally or vertically. This ensures proper ventilation and stability.
 Figure 2: The PS5 console base attachment
**For Vertical Positioning:**
1.	Place your console on a soft surface with the disc slot side facing down.
2.	Position the base over the circular attachment point on the bottom of the console.
3.	Remove the screw cover cap from the base and take out the screw.
4.	Align the base with the attachment point and secure it by turning the screw clockwise.
5.	Replace the screw cover cap.

**For Horizontal Positioning:**
1.	Rotate the base so the clamps are facing outward.
2.	Place your console on a soft surface with the white cover facing up.
3.	Align the base with the marked area on the back of the console.
4.	Press the base firmly until it clicks into place.
**Why This Matters:** The console base is essential for proper airflow and stability. Without it, your PS5 may overheat or become damaged if it falls over.
**Horizontal vs. Vertical Positioning**
 Figure 3: PS5 in both horizontal and vertical positions
The PS5 can be positioned either horizontally or vertically based on your space and preference. Consider these factors when deciding:
**Vertical Positioning:**
- Takes up less horizontal spac
- Provides optimal airflow
- Requires more vertical clearance (at least 4 inches above)
- May be less stable in households with pets or small children
**Horizontal Positioning:**
- More stable configuration
- Better for tight shelves with limited height
- Still requires at least 4 inches of clearance on all sides
- Disc slot will be on the left side
**Why This Matters:** Proper positioning affects both the console's cooling efficiency and its stability. Always ensure adequate ventilation regardless of position.

### Connections and Cables 
**HDMI Connection**
The PS5 uses HDMI 2.1 for video and audio output to your display.
 Figure 4: Connecting the HDMI cable to the PS5 and TV
1.	Locate the HDMI OUT port on the back of your PS5.
2.	Connect one end of the included HDMI cable to this port.
3.	Connect the other end to an available HDMI port on your TV or monitor.
4.	Note which HDMI input you've used on your TV (HDMI 1, 2, etc.).
**Best Practices:**
- Use the HDMI cable provided with your PS5 for optimal performance.
- For 4K/120Hz gameplay, connect to an HDMI 2.1 compatible port on your TV (if available).
- If your TV supports multiple HDMI standards, use the highest version available (typically labeled as "HDMI 2.1" or "4K").
**Why This Matters:** The HDMI connection determines your visual and audio experience. Using the correct port and cable ensures you get the best possible quality your display can support.
**Power Connection**
 Figure 5: Connecting the power cable to the PS5
1.	Locate the AC IN port on the back of your PS5.
2.	Insert the power cord firmly into this port.
3.	Connect the other end to a wall outlet or surge protector.
**Best Practices:**
- Connect directly to a wall outlet when possible.
- If using a surge protector, ensure it can handle the PS5's power requirements.
- Avoid using extension cords or daisy-chaining power strips.
**Why This Matters:** Stable power is crucial for preventing data corruption and hardware damage. The PS5 consumes significant power, especially during intensive gaming sessions.
**Internet Connection**
**Wired Connection**
A wired connection provides the most stable and fastest internet experience.
 Figure 6: Connecting an Ethernet cable to the PS5
1.	Locate the LAN port on the back of your PS5.
2.	Connect one end of an Ethernet cable (not included) to this port.
3.	Connect the other end to an available port on your router or network switch.
**Best Practices:**
- Use Cat 6 or better Ethernet cables for optimal performance.
- Keep cable runs under 100 meters (328 feet).
- Avoid sharp bends in the cable.
**Wireless Connection**
If a wired connection isn't possible, the PS5 supports Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax).
1.	You'll configure Wi-Fi during the initial system setup.
2.	Have your Wi-Fi network name (SSID) and password ready.
**Best Practices:**
- Position your PS5 as close to your router as possible.
- Reduce physical obstructions between your PS5 and router.
- Consider a mesh network system for large homes.
- Use the 5GHz band when available for faster speeds.
**Why This Matters:** Your internet connection affects download speeds, online gameplay performance, and streaming quality. A stable connection is essential for the best experience.

### Controller Setup 
**Charging Your DualSense Controller**
 Figure 7: Charging the DualSense controller via USB-C
1.	Locate the USB-C port on the top of your DualSense controller.
2.	Connect the small end of the included USB-C cable to this port.
3.	Connect the larger USB-A end to one of the USB ports on your PS5.
4.	The light bar will pulse orange while charging and turn off when fully charged.
**Best Practices:**
- Charge the controller fully before first use (approximately 3 hours).
- The controller can be charged while the console is in Rest Mode.
- For extended play sessions, consider purchasing a second controller or charging station.
**Why This Matters:** The DualSense controller has a battery life of approximately 6-12 hours depending on usage. Proper charging ensures uninterrupted gameplay.
**Pairing Your Controller**
 Figure 8: Pairing a DualSense controller with the PS5
