# Manual Assessment Memo

**MEMORANDUM**  
**TO:** Ms. CEO of Product Company  
**FROM:** Savana Thomas  
**SUBJECT:** Recommendations for the PlayStation 5 Product manual  
**DATE:** February 13, 2025  

I evaluated the manual for the PlayStation 5 at [manual website](https://www.manua.ls/sony/playstation-5/manual)  

The strengths of the manual are how descriptive and specific of each topic the instructions are. They go into a lot of detail in order to prevent damage and ensure the proper use of the PlayStation. 

The weaknesses would be in the organization of the content. In addition to this the default position for the PlayStation is horizontal and the manual describes how to switch to the vertical orientation but fails to mention the potential internal harm that can come from doing this.

To improve this manual I would recommend the following changes:
- Rearrange the topics so that the installation of additional storage comes after the general hardware specifications and warranty as they would certainly have an impact on the decision on what storage would be chosen.
- Include an addendum to the Precautions section under either the Use and Handling or Handling the Base subsections describing the potential repercussions of switching to vertical orientation.

AI Statement: I used Microsoft Word spellcheck to improve this assignment
